This is quick and dirty undo search script. Too many things are hardcoded, etc..

Requires http://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html and SQLite3 python libraries.

Usage:
undo_search.py time_in_milliseconds_per_move
(it was originally nodes/move, but asmFish doesn't support it)

Currently engines are hardcocded into script, search for UndoSearch method __init__
and there for "stockfish_log_time" and "brainfish_log". Also you might want to edit "SyzygyPath".

Interrupting: create file named break_search.flag where script is running.
Positions are stored in SQLite3 and if chess.db exitsts, then search is resumed.

To mark book moves in alpha_beta log file, run:
book_moves.py brainfish_timestamp.log log/alpha_beta_timestamp.log > output.log

Edit paths in brainfish_log script.
